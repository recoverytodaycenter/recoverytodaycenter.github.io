<p>
  Controlled substances are drugs such as Fentanyl that are controlled under government standards or the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). 
  The best drug rehab programs are designed to help clients beat their addictions. Individuals with this disorder typically experience many specific negative emotions (vulnerability, hostility, sadness, anxiety, etc.) or a nonspecific but intense sense of distress or “feeling bad.” This is combined with an inability to monitor and control emotions, alternating chaotic or contradictory ways of relating to self and others, and self-harm or dramatically self-destructive behaviors. 
  For individuals in the early stages of change, placement in treatment that is too advanced and that does not address ambivalence regarding behavior change may lead to early termination from the program. 
  In milder cases, a care provider will administer the medications to the patient in his own home.
